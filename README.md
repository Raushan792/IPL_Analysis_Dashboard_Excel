| Table | Type | Columns |
|---|---|---|
| `fact_match` | ⚙️ Fact | match_id, team_id, venue_id, runs, wickets, win_type |
| `fact_player` | ⚙️ Fact | player_id, match_id, runs, wickets, strike_rate, economy |
| `dim_team` | 📋 Dimension | team_id, team_name |
| `dim_player` | 📋 Dimension | player_id, player_name |
| `dim_venue` | 📋 Dimension | venue_id, venue_name |

> ✅ **Zero VLOOKUPs.** All relationships are defined inside the **Power Pivot Data Model** — exactly how it's done in enterprise BI.

## 💡 Why This Is Different From a Basic Excel Dashboard

| Basic Excel Dashboard | This Project |
|---|---|
| VLOOKUP to join data | Power Pivot relationships |
| Hardcoded values | DAX dynamic measures |
| Single flat table | Star Schema (fact + dimension tables) |
| Static charts | Fully interactive Pivot Charts + Slicers |
| One sheet | 9 organized sheets with clean architecture |

> This project mirrors how **real BI tools like Power BI and Tableau** handle data — just built entirely in Excel.
